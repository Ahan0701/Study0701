## Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a linear equation used for predicting a value of something when there are multiple data sets with a different rate of change. Regression analysis stems from the idea that given data have a certain tendency. The main purpose of regression analysis is to explain the tendency among variables. When expressed mathematically, the regression model is divided into a part that shows a trend and a part that shows an uncontrollable error. The equation has the form Y= a + bX, where Y is the dependent variable, X is the independent variable, b is the slope of the line, and a is the y-intercept.
